A snowstorm hit our settlement! The temperatures fell to dangerous levels, be extremely wary of sending people outside of heat zone and heated buildings - the danger of freezing to death is immense!
[NOT USED] Weather is cold, but clear. There are no adverse effects. People in the heat zone will stay warm. Outside they will slowly loose heat.
[NOT USED] Clear
Weather is clear.
[NOT USED] It's cold. People in the heat zone will be just cold, but outside will loose heat much faster. During the night people in tents will be cold, but staying in bunkhouses is nice and comfortable.
[NOT USED] Cold
[NOT USED] Weather warning! Cold weather!
[NOT USED] Weather is terrible. Even the heat zone is cold now, freezing during the night. Tents no longer shield from cold during the night. Bunkhouses are the only option to stay relatively warm. Going outside the heat zone is very dangerous and will lead to freezing. Fuel upkeep is doubled as more power is needed to sustain heat.

Justice
For wrongs of the past
Not repeating past mistakes
We try to stay united
Justice
For wrongs of the past
Rejected
They went away
On the blood of those in need
We founded our city
... or revenge?
Justice
Isn't that enough?
But we survived
Justice
... or revenge?
Let's hope we never meet again
We left them without help
we can hope...
At least
Stewards of the future
We were chosen
Forced us to choose
But winter
Made us blind
And our mission
We found another city
Helpless in the cold
To look for others
We didn't even care
Lives were more important
We decided to help
But didn't do enough
We tried to help
But we didn't care
Our mission was more important
To fulfil our goal
Doing everything we could
We saved all the Arks
Some Arks survived
The Arks perished
New Manchester
Perished
But after the storm
We found another city
But New Manchester was hit hard
Only half of them survived
New Manchester did not make it
The few who survived the storm died soon after
We saved New Manchester
But more importantly
We took our chances
But can we call it a triumph?
Silent
Frozen
We took our chances
And saved our humanity
We did not take the risk
Of saving the others
It will have to be our legacy
Let that be our legacy
Some refugees
We started as a small society
No food
90 people
Old habits
Morning gatherings
Corpses in Snow Pits
Children helping with research
Turning away refugees
Outbreaks of protests
Watchful guards
Prisons

Thin soup
14 hour workdays

We haven't crossed the line
With such a small community?
But will we survive

New London
In the summer of 1886, the snowstorms began. Crops failed, people starved and millions fled south. They met only chaos, famine and death.</n></n>In the farthest reaches of the resource-rich north, the British Empire began construction of heat-bearing Generators so a chosen few could survive the chaos of crumbling civilization.</n></n>They ran out of time.
An apocalyptic ice storm came from the south, devouring everything in its path. People fled in panic. Some managed to cross the seas and reach the site of a Generator, only to find it frozen solid.</n></n>The Generator was designed to power a city capable of weathering the end of the world...</n>
It falls to us to build it.

To save this patient's life, we had to perform an amputation. As a result, this person won't be able to work.

Frostbite
The Dangers of the Cold

USE A STEAM CORE TO FIX IT
The Generator has been damaged and is going to blow. We can fix it, but only a child is small enough to fit into its mechanisms.</n></n>Alternatively, a Steam Core could be used to shunt some pressure from the damaged assembly.
It's going to blow! 
The Generator 
I SEE
The Generator stress has reached a dangerous level. Be careful - when the stress reaches 100%, the Generator will explode.</n></n>The stress increases when the overdrive is on and when the Generator is heating up.

I SEE
The Generator stress level is at critical level, you have to turn off the overdrive. </n>Now! 
Turn off the Overdrive!
The Automatons
I see
Sir, an automaton stopped working because it was unable to recharge itself from the Generator or a Steam Hub. It has to do that twice daily. In order to make it operational again you need to turn on the Generator.

I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
Sir, an engineer is here to see you. He has a letter to you from his team.</n></n>"My workers asked me to deliver this.

Sir, the Automaton Project is complete. It has delivered magnificent improvements of the automatons and cut their cost.</n></n>Unfortunately, the pioneering engineer has been killed by a Steam Core explosion. Perhaps the long nights spent in his workshop made him less careful than usual. Thankfully, we managed to recover his blueprints.
A costly success

Shut down the {workplace}
Sir, an automaton has entangled itself hopelessly in its assigned building. We can't free it without at least partially dismantling one or the other, and that means shutting down either the automaton or the building.

LET HIM GO WITH A WARNING
Sir, we caught an amputee stealing from the stockpiles. He argues that he wants to return to work and wanted to make himself a prosthesis to do so.</n></n>"I've lived in a Care House since my accident. I wanted to make myself useful again, so I made this." He proudly presents a crude prosthesis fitted in place of his missing hand. "Now I can finally get back to work! I'm sorry I took the materials, but nobody listened when I asked for them."

WE MUST BUILD SUCH A HOME
Sir, one of our men insists on living in the street. We've brought him to you so that maybe you can talk some sense into him.</n></n>"Look, sir, everything I ever had I earned myself. I'll be damned if I take up space under a roof when I have no way to pay for it. And since I've lost my hand, I can't work, so that's that." He turns to leave, but hesitates, then sighs.

Sir, a group of amputees is here to see you. They want to help in the Cookhouse.</n></n>"We don't want to sit on our arses all day, content with just being kept alive. We can't do hard work any more, but if we fashion some simple prostheses out of wood, we can help in the Cookhouse and earn our keep."

Well done
Sir, the doctor who was trying to improve Radical Treatment is here. He is reporting a breakthrough!</n></n>"It's certainly an unorthodox method and my learned colleagues would be appalled at the experiments I had to perform... but it works. I expect the number of amputations during Radical Treatment to be halved."</n>He seems eager to get back to his everyday work and try his new method.
Fewer amputations

The city must survive
A howling gale bursts upon the city and the Generator creaks and groans under the weight of the wind.

Sir, a man is here to see you. He says that his daughter ran away after the news of the storm spread.

"I must find her before she's lost for good. She's all I have left."

Sir, the man who wanted to go after his runaway daughter has quietly left the city. 20 Food Rations have also disappeared from the stockpile. It seems he took matters into his own hands.

Sir, it's a miracle! The man who went looking for his daughter is back.

They are both exhausted and frostbitten, but very happy.

IT'S MY DUTY
Sir, the runaway girl has returned! She was found huddled in a warm spot right by the Generator. She's starving, exhausted and frostbitten.</n></n>We think she must've turned back soon after leaving the city, although it's still a miracle that she survived at all.

Sir, the family living in this house... They're all dead.

Sir, a group of young men has gathered around a house. They claim that the family living there is harbouring symbols of the old religion. They want to get rid of them in order to purify the city.</n></n>The family explains that these are priceless relics from the times before the catastrophe. They want to preserve them.

Sir, a man from the family that was allowed to keep their relics as a result of your order is here to talk to you. He says that initially they were left alone, but later someone marked their door with a red X.</n></n>Now nobody returns their greetings in the street, people cut in line in front of them, and their children are shunned by their former friends. He asks you to do something about it.

Sir, with your blessing our people walked from home to home, collecting symbols of the old faith to destroy them. This is a new beginning!</n></n>A bonfire of books has been started in front of the Generator. Next to it men stomp on porcelain figurines with visible zeal. A few women stand some distance away, crying.
Burning faith

Sir, people are rioting in the streets and demanding that you stop what you're doing. They say this isn't what our Faith stands for, that you're destroying everything beautiful and pure about it to gain absolute control over our lives. They shout that this is madness, and that you're a usurper, not our true shepherd.</n></n>Roughly a quarter of our people are determined to fight. The others are silent...

We enter the camp, appearing out of the driving snow. A choir of excited voices welcomes us: "Thank God you found us! We had been wandering for days until we couldn't go on any longer. Soon we'd begin to starve." Children and adults surround us, packed and ready to go.
A happy reunion
Crash Site
We collected: {baseResources}
Take resources
There is plenty of priceless supplies in the wrecks of our expedition. Searching among the crates scattered in the snow behind the wrecks, we found the bodies. They're tangled together in a single frozen mass, as if these people were trying to find at least a bit of warmth just before they died. We can do nothing for them, not even bury them.</n></n>

Children's Hideout
Children's Hideout
We formed the children ({survivors}) into an orderly column and set off towards the city. They walk quietly and resolutely, like little adults, the youngest clutching their toys tightly. This is going to be a long journey. Please have enough warm beds prepared for their arrival.
We took care of the children

Children's Hideout
As you ordered, we gave the children ({survivors}) a map and pointed them in the right direction. They looked at us in disbelief, and the youngest started to cry. Left with no other choice, they set out towards the city in a long, ragged column. There's a few dozen of them, but we don't think you'll need to prepare quite so many bunks.
The children went to the city
The children will have to walk to our city on their own. It will take longer and some of them will die.
Send the children to the city
We talked to the children in the hideout. They said that one night their teachers and some hunters took them out from Winterhome on a "secret adventure". Teachers told them they're going to stay here for a while. When the food ran low, their guardians went back to get more and didn't return.</n></n>It seems these kids were evacuated in time, before things in their city got really ugly.
Little survivors
Ice Corridor
We proceeded with the exploration.
There's nothing to do here.
Carry on
We marvel at the thick slabs of ice that have been crushed and swept aside by the American dreadnought Hephaestus. Soon we might be able to learn how it managed to accomplish such feats – we can see a huge silhouette in the distance, which might be its sister ship Prometheus.

Only take the stored coal
This coal mine was in operation until very recently. The machinery isn't running now, but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. Perhaps the mine simply extracted its quota or filled the loading bay.</n></n>We could retrieve plenty of raw materials if we took the machinery apart.</n></n>

As soon as our scouts entered the city, we lost contact with them. There's no telling what happened, but we presume they're all dead.
We entered the city
We've seen a thing or two in our lives, but nothing has ever frightened us as much as this blasted lightning. Until we figured out how to switch it off, that is. Now we'll be able to establish an Outpost here.

Risk entering the city
"Able minds and bodies will prevail over the cold", reads the slogan over the entrance to Tesla City. A central tall tower shines with the blue glow of electric discharges, which form a protective dome over the town.</n></n>But something went wrong here: there are charred bodies lying in the streets and the stench of burned flesh taints the air. We saw a lightning streak from the tower, hitting a building and leaving a gash in its roof.
Thunder unleashed
Cave Hideout
Tesla's Grave
It has turned out that these rifles were not loaded. The Americans ({survivors}) fought to the end, but they were so weak that they had no chance. We found Tesla's body inside the cave and we buried him there, along with his killers.
We charged at them
The scouts will try to overpower the Americans.
Attack them
Tesla's Grave
Seeing that we have no ill intentions, the Americans told us how they "dealt justice" to the inventor after expelling him from his city. We buried Tesla's battered body in the cave and are heading home with these poor wretches in tow ({survivors}).
Nothing like small talk
The scouts will try to reason with the Americans and convince them to join us.
Talk to them
As we approach the cave, its inhabitants pull out rifles and take positions behind the wall barring the entrance. They are in a bad shape, weak from malnourishment and illness.

Leave the village intact
This fishing village used to supply Tesla City with food. Searching it, we found a letter: "Mike, don't return to the city. Tesla is a madman. He cast out all the amputees, all the sick. Jerry's parents and old Beth are among them. There will be blood, that's for sure, and soon."</n></n>The village was left in order. We could send a team here to start fishing.

The dreadnought is stripped of useful machinery, but its hulk contains enough steel to justify establishing an outpost here.</n></n>On the bridge we found a log with Tesla's last orders: "Transfer all supplies and able-bodied survivors aboard Hephaestus. Take the amputees only if you have prostheses to make them useful."

Some of exiles are still alive, just barely. We could try to bring them to our city, although they might die on the way.</n></n>One of the dying held a diary to his chest. We read the last entry: "Exiled from Tesla City, with food and fuel running out, we sent the strongest among us to search for help. They're our last hope." We're afraid this refers to these poor Yankees we buried.

The man we’ve seen from afar was nowhere to be found. Searching his burrow, we found a diary of a scientist who fled Winterhome. After the starving city fell into chaos, its leader, an Army captain, appointed himself an absolute ruler. He tried to impose order using force. Plenty of people, disgruntled, deserted the city and most of the others rebelled against him.

We've won a hard-fought victory over fear and despair.</n></n>The tragedy of Winterhome crushed our hope, but not our spirit. We now stand united once again, stronger than ever, in the face of an uncertain future.
We are united
The Londoners
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
Sir, several of the people who wanted to flee to London have decided to trust you and stay! They say that your recent decisions convinced them there is hope for us here yet.
First Londoners convinced to stay
The Londoners
I SEE
Sir, the people who want to leave for London have successfully urged their friends and neighbours to join them. People are more easily persuaded, because they have little hope in our ultimate survival.
People join the Londoners
The Londoners
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT
For the first time, the Londoners have failed to persuade anyone to abandon our city and flee to London. People are recovering from their shock at the news of Winterhome and starting to hope for the future.
People regain hope
The Londoners
CALM DOWN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIE
Sir, you've convinced the majority, but hope is low. A group of our people are still so scared that they want to flee the city for London in 15 days. They've come to try to change your mind.</n></n>"You say that faith will save us? Nonsense! What, are we going to pray for food when we start to starve?!" shouts one of them. "If we don't try to reach London, we'll end up like Winterhome!" 
The unconvinced want to leave

If we don't try to reach London, we'll end up like Winterhome!"
The unconvinced want to leave
The Londoners
WE SHALL PRAY FOR THEM
The Londoners file out of the city. One of them stops in front of you for a moment. She looks like she's about to say something, but she just sighs, shakes her head and follows the others.</n></n>They soon vanish in the whiteout, their tracks erased by the tumbling snow.

Sir, the time is at hand. The Londoners have gathered around the Generator for the last time. They are going to leave the city. This is our last chance to stop them from committing mass suicide. Whatever they said and did, they're still our people... even if they no longer think so.
They are leaving

IT HAD TO BE DONE
You ordered the Faith Keepers to stop the Londoners at all costs, despite their wishes. Trapped like caged animals, they fought tooth and nail for their right to decide their own fate.

Sir! The priest you sent to challenge the Londoners' speaker... He's dead. They hanged him from the Generator. A piece of paper was found pinned to his lifeless body with "LIARS" written on it.

One of our people has quietly left the city in the night. He left a note: "Captain, I apologise for leaving my post. I have to follow the Londoners. I have to try bring my daughter back, or at least die with her if I can't persuade her. I'm sorry, but I can't abandon my child. Wish me luck."

Sir, the thief you ordered to be released has been beaten up. People decided to take justice into their own hands, probably because they feel that when you dispersed their protest, you treated them worse than the thief we caught.</n>They'll make sure he doesn't steal again.

We have to survive
We fled from London and crossed the sea to reach the frozen north. On the way our convoy was hit by a blizzard and scattered.</n></n>A handful of us managed to reach the site of this Generator, only to find it frozen solid and abandoned. Why is no one here? Did any of our people survive the blizzard? Are there any others out there?</n></n>Whatever we do, we should expect the worst now that the world as we know it has crumbled.

"They're all dead?! How will we survive here without any help? We have to go back to London!

Some of them want to drop everything and flee to London. Panic is starting to set in.

IGNORE IT
Sir, the prisoner who complained about the cold was taken to the medics with severe frostbite. He'll spend the rest of his life without an arm now. The wardens gave him a blanket as you ordered, but it was wet, and they moved him to an unheated cell.

Sir, one of our people has committed suicide. In his spare time, he wrote poems about loss, suffering, and the death of hope.

HE ASKED FOR IT
Our loyal citizens have killed the traitor as he attempted to escape.</n></n>He must have guessed why our guards were approaching him, because he tried to flee the moment he saw them.

The engineer broke down when he saw people weren't swayed by his lies. He was killed during an attempt to escape capture.

Our loyal citizens have dealt with the traitorous engineer. There were no other casualties.</n></n>During the lecture, our people began to counter the engineer's lies.

Captain, it seems that the traitorous engineer we imprisoned has friends. Someone's set him free!</n></n>He was briefly seen speaking to some people on the street.

We keep our distance as the lords continue to suffer.

From a safe distance, we can see there are crowds of people here. Most of them are hungry and exhausted. We shouldn’t get too close. There’s no telling what these people could do. We did turn our backs on them after all.

The chest we found contains an engineer's tools and a death note. "You lured me here with promises, kept me in the dark, told my wife I'd died... You're beyond contempt. I hope you enjoyed my farewell gift." It seems that the people it was intended for never read the note. And we can only hope that we don't become the recipients of whatever "gift" he left for them.
The engineer's curse
We have no use for these gems of knowledge and culture yet, but there will be a time when we return here to reclaim humanity's legacy.
There's nothing here we can use right now.

This is indeed the vault in which the lords planned to preserve as much of their wealth as they could. Yet there isn't much in the way of gold, apart from some ancient jewellery and other works of art – there are wonders of science and knowledge here. Instruments, books, newspapers and letters.
Useless riches

This group of our people got lost after an avalanche separated them from the others. Exhausted, they stopped here to recover, but their supplies are running out. On their way here they saw a large, peculiar structure buried in the snow. They have no idea what it is, other than that it was man-made.

This liner brought many rich people here. They could afford to travel in luxury even in these desperate times. On the bridge we found a letter from Lord Craven to the captain. It reads:</n></n>“If we encounter any of the vessels stolen by the workers, you are authorised to open fire.“ A naval gun crudely bolted to the foredeck confirms that he really did want us dead.

We put the lords on sleds and set out towards our city.

Save them against their will
We honoured the dying lords' last wish.
Let them die and bury them.
Honour their request
The red flag (actually a duvet case) flies over the most pitiful camp we’ve ever seen. "I'm glad to see you, although I wish we'd met sooner," croaks one of the lords. "I regret that I can only implore you to give us a proper burial. We're dying and have chosen not to fight it any more. Please, respect our final request."
Dying wish
We buried the bodies of the refugees.
This is all we can do for them
Bury the bodies
A shallow depression by the bend shelters a small camp. In the snow-covered makeshift tents we find nothing but dead bodies. Amongst them are two children who match the description of the lost children. They must have stumbled upon this camp after they got lost, but then their luck ran out.

A Word of Advice

Captain, when facing demands, remember this: people usually look for the quickest solution, not the best one. You don't have to agree to everything they ask for. If you fix the problem your way, it's fine.

A Word of Advice
I SEE
A heat zone has reached the Snow Pit and the bodies are beginning to rot! Dangerous diseases could begin to spread in our city.</n></n>We should either move the Snow Pit or scale back the heat zone.
Danger of disease
A Word of Advice
I SEE
It seemed unthinkable in the past, but this is a new world and we have to adapt. The bodies of our dead can now be utilised to help us survive, so we've started keeping a tally of how many we have.
Counting the bodies
Let's get to work!
We've been chosen to safeguard a priceless treasure – the seeds and seedlings of plants from all over the world. They've been deposited in Seedling Arks to stop them from freezing, but it falls to us to build a city to protect these precious buildings until the winter ends, however long that may be.</n></n>The only way to do this is with automatons. We'll ensure the green earth is reborn – even if we aren't there to witness it.
The Seedling Arks
A Word of Advice
I see
Captain, we've run out of Steam Cores. We know there are some industrial ruins to the north and south. We might find more Steam Cores there.

We will do what we can
Howling winds descend on the city and all communications with the outside world are cut off.</n></n>We did what we could. Now we have to wait and pray we've done enough.
The storm hits the city
The Seedling Arks
Hope falls drastically.
It's all we can do
Captain, our collections of seeds, spores and seedlings are no more. Perhaps we could've done more to protect them, but if we had, we might not have survived.</n></n>Now the only thing we can do is save ourselves – and try to help the people of New Manchester.
All the Seedling Arks have frozen
The Seedling Arks
Hope falls drastically.
I see
Captain, one of our Seedling Arks has frozen. Its contents have perished... We must make sure that it doesn't happen again!
The seedlings have frozen
The Seedling Arks
I see
Captain, the temperature in one of Seedling Arks has dropped too low. If we do nothing, it's precious contents will be lost.</n></n>We mustn't let that happen!
The seedlings are in danger
The Seedling Arks
I see
Captain, in a few days the temperature will drop. Our Seedling Arks will be in danger. We have to keep them warm with Heaters or Steam Hubs.
The Seedling Arks might freeze
The Seedling Arks
I see
We must ensure that the Seedling Arks don't freeze.</n></n>All the seedlings and many of the tropical seeds are very sensitive to the cold. If the temperature in any Seedling Ark falls below |#color=4ac5e8|Chilly|#defaultcolor| for too long, its precious contents will be irreversibly damaged.
Preserve the seedlings
The Seedling Arks
I see
Captain, with the Beacon operational we can clearly see the storm approaching from the south.</n></n>It's still some distance away, but we'd better keep an eye on it and make sure we set up the infrastructure needed to heat the Arks before it hits.

Sir, an exhausted man has just reached our city, badly frostbitten and with a harrowing story to tell.</n></n>He says he's come from a nearby city called New Manchester. It's inhabited mostly by workers and their families, but their resources are running out and they're in trouble.

[DO NOT TRANSLATE] Każcie mu się wynosić z miasta!
[DO NOT TRANSLATE] Przesłuchaliśmy go. To technik obsługujący generator. Nie jest sabotażystą, pracował tylko nad usprawnieniem wydajności generatora. Niestety błąd który popełnił spowodował nieodwracalnego uszkodzenia systemu chłodzenia, które powoduje zużywanie się steamcora ponad 100x szybciej. Jedynym ratunkiem jest poszukiwanie nowego domu.
[DO NOT TRANSLATE] Sabotażysta
[DO NOT TRANSLATE] Pora poszukać nowego domu.

When all the trees near a Sawmill are cut down, dismantle it and find a good location for a new one.
When all the trees near a Sawmill are cut down, dismantle it and find a good location for a new one.
Wall Drills are a good alternative to Sawmills. They provide more Wood and their source of Wood doesn't run out.
Charcoal Kilns can deal with excess Wood supply by turning it into Coal.
Hunters check their traps during the night, bringing Raw Food to the city in the morning.
There are four sources of Coal: Coal Mines, Coal Thumpers, Charcoal Kilns and Outpost Depots.
More advanced versions of buildings have better insulation and are warmer.
Your scouts may encounter deadly threats in Frostland. Be wary when ordering them to do something risky.
Scouts returning to the city move faster. They're travelling along a known route, and the promise of a warm bed does wonders.
Meals are served in the Cookhouse. People will go there in their free time if they're hungry.
When there's no food, people will become hungry, then starving, then they'll die.
When it became clear that the winter wouldn't end, the British Empire began building Generators in the north, away from the chaos of crumbling civilisation. Other nations followed suit.
There are many theories about what has caused the global winter. Despite much research, nobody can say for certain why it happened.
Sceptics and governments continued to deny global cooling until their cities descended into anarchy and were buried in snow.
Winter has come.
The eruptions of Mount Tambora and Krakatoa are thought to be amongst the causes of the great winter, although scientists agree they weren't enough to cause the cataclysm.
A cooling sun could be one of the reasons for the global winter. However, the volcanic ash blanketing most of the earth's atmosphere makes precise measurements impossible.
One of the reasons for choosing the Arctic as the last refuge of civilisation was the abundance of Coal deposits.
The Arctic animals and plants, well adapted to winter conditions, will provide us with an important source of food, at least until the real cold comes.
The abrupt cooling caused utter chaos in the atmosphere. The mightiest winds, no longer confined to its upper layers, descend on earth, wreaking destruction in their path.
All over the world, people flocked to temples to seek comfort and beg their gods for forgiveness. Doomsday cults sprang up in record numbers.
In 1872, a Turkish astronomer presented a paper about his discovery of a new meteor shower to the Académie des sciences.
Many people in Northern Europe renounced Christianity in favor of the old gods, claiming that the global winter was Fimbulvetr, the prelude to Ragnarök.
At the onset of the great winter, many scientists and explorers travelled north to study the causes of the calamity and survey for places to build the Generators.
The monumental effort of designing, transporting and constructing the Generators in the north brought the British Empire to the brink of economic collapse. Then the real cold came.
Thousands of workers perished from cold, malnutrition and accidents while preparing the Generator sites.
Southern countries and colonies were the first to fall. Unprepared for the cold, they quickly descended into anarchy. Millions died of disease and starvation.
The Generators were located away from the rest of civilisation to ensure the project could be completed in the face of growing unrest and chaos.
You can build a Bunkhouse over an existing Tent. Many other buildings can be upgraded in this manner.
Working overtime for too long will make your people discontented.
Your progress is saved automatically at the end of each game day, but you can save it at any moment.
Having more than one Workshop significantly boosts your research rate.
Bunkhouses are warmer than Tents, and Houses are warmer than Bunkhouses.
Some buildings, such as Cookhouses and Medical Posts, stop working if the temperature inside drops below Chilly.
Some buildings, such as the Infirmary, have better insulation and are warmer.
Steam buildings are more efficient than basic buildings, and Advanced buildings are more efficient than Steam buildings.
Plan ahead. If you're only reacting to crises, one slip too many will mean that your people – or you – end up dead.
When installing additional Heaters or upgrading the Generator, remember: More power means higher Coal use.
People who have to eat poor-quality food for too long will become discontented.
In the Infirmary, the gravely ill can be cured without risky procedures that could leave them as amputees.
Patients recover twice as fast in an Infirmary as they do in a Medical Post.
People's chance of falling ill depends on the conditions in which they work and live.
People who live or work in Very Cold conditions can get frostbite and become gravely ill.
People who live or work in Freezing conditions can get such bad frostbite that they have to undergo an amputation.
People who fall ill will try to go to a medical facility as soon as they have free time.
People who are gravely ill will leave work when a free bed in a medical facility becomes available.
Untreated sick people will become gravely ill, then die.
Some buildings and laws will give you access to building abilities. Used wisely, they can make a world of difference in difficult situations... but at a cost.
If you reach peak discontent, people will give you an ultimatum. If you fail, it will be the end of your rule.
If hope falls to zero, people will give you an ultimatum. If you fail, it will be the end of your rule.
When hope or discontent start to get out of hand, look for laws and buildings that affect them.
The Fighting Arena lowers the discontent of people living in the vicinity. Watching fights is good stress relief!
People who are homeless don't get any benefits from entertainment such as the Public House or Fighting Arenas.
If you ignore the requests and needs of your people, they will return after some time and demand more.
When someone dies, people will lose hope. If there is no place to bury the dead, they will become discontented.
Ignoring the needs of your people will cause discontent.
When you promise something and then fail to deliver, your people will lose some hope and their discontent will rise.
Fulfilling a promise will make people hopeful.
You can soften the blow of each death by signing the Ceremonial Funerals law. Hope will still fall, but only half as much.
Remember, every law will have unforeseen consequences sooner or later.
People working on Emergency Shifts will become discontented. For some of them the consequences may be more serious.
Remember, your people need to eat and sleep from time to time. As do you.

The prospect of so many lords coming here has caused understandable tension. The conflict between people from different social classes could jeopardise the future of our city. In the next few days the shape of our society may well be completely redefined.
Face the lords
The lords are waiting outside our city. They are now a constant danger to the peace and order here. We need to have men on lookout for them. We also need to build Guarded Outpost Depots to protect our city.
Secure the city
We haven't built enough defences in time. Our people are frightened and angry. They're beginning to get out of control.
We failed to secure our people
We've built enough defences. The lords will never threaten us again. Our city is safe and people return to their duties with relief.
City secured
The arrival of so many starving people requires immediate action. We must feed and find homes for them as soon as possible.
Lords' basic needs
Too many people have been left without the essentials.</n></n>|#color=d21820|Hope falls drastically</n>Discontent rises drastically
Lords' basic needs unfulfilled
You've managed to provide food and shelter for everyone.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
Lords' basic needs fulfilled
The arrival of so many starving people requires immediate action. Besides housing them, we need to provide more efficient sources of Raw Food, such as Hunters' Hangars or Industrial Hothouses.
Improve food infrastructure
You have failed to provide more advanced food facilities. Without them, it will be much harder to keep people from starving.</n></n>|#color=d21820|Hope falls drastically</n>Discontent rises drastically

The old and new animosities between the lords and our people will make coexistence very difficult. To protect the future of our city, you will have to contain the social unrest quickly before it escalates.
Resolve class conflict
You've failed to end the enmity between the lords and our people. Our society is even more divided than on the day the lords arrived. The situation in our city is getting out of control.
Class conflict unresolved
You did it! The social unrest has been eased. We're on the right path to ending the enmity between our people and the lords.

We’ve reached the Generator site and the seedlings are safely stored in the Seedling Arks.</n></n>We were supposed to deploy automatons to make sure the city can run itself no matter the weather, but the transport carrying the Factory plans was lost in a blizzard.</n></n>We need to build a Beacon and send a team to search for it.
Factory plans
Excellent! Now we can start setting up the automated infrastructure to keep the Seedling Arks at a safe temperature.</n></n>Bring back the plans, set up a Factory and increase the number of automatons to 3.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
Factory plans found
The automatons are performing admirably. Now we have to make enough of them to automate all the critical operations in the city before the storm hits.</n></n>It's the only way to ensure that the Seedling Arks will be supported during the storm.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
Autonomous city
Sir, we don't have many Steam Cores left. Without them we can't manufacture automatons and build our autonomous city. We need to start looking for them in Frostland.
A lack of Steam Cores
Excellent work! The Seedling Arks are now being safely maintained by the automatons. All critical operations are secured, and we still have time to spare before the storm hits.</n></n>If we're to have a shot at surviving, we have to gather as many supplies as we can.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
The city is autonomous
Our city is ready for the storm. Now all we can do is wait and hope we have done enough to survive.</n></n>The poor bastards in New Manchester, though...</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
The city is ready
At your command, all aid activites for New Manchester will cease immediately.</n></n>All that remains is for us to prepare ourselves for the storm.
Help for New Manchester stopped
You promised to keep critical automated operations in the city intact, but you broke that promise.</n></n>Those who wished you hadn't endangered our mission will be angry...
Failure to Keep Infrastructure Intact
You have convinced people you can help New Manchester without endangering our mission.</n></n>They trust you completely and are willing to follow you as long as necessary.
Infrastructure Kept Intact
We've decided to focus on our mission and abandon the search for New Manchester. Its people will be left to their fate.
The search is called off
We've decided to focus on our mission and leave New Manchester to its fate. The future of life on Earth is more important than any city.
We won't help New Manchester
First we need to find the way to New Manchester. Their messenger can't locate it on the map.</n></n>He says that their team crossed a windswept glacier, nearly perishing on the way. 
Finding the way
We've found New Manchester, but its people are lacking almost everything needed to survive. We can try to help them, but only automatons will be able to carry supplies across the windswept wasteland to them.</n></n>If we want to help them survive the storm, first they need construction materials - Wood and Steel - to build shelters. This is just the beginning. They will need much more, especially food and coal.
Aid for New Manchester
We’ve decided to support New Manchester, but its people are lacking almost everything they need to survive. We can try to help them, but only automatons will be able to carry supplies across the windswept wasteland to them.</n></n>If we want to help them survive the storm, first they need construction materials – Wood and Steel – to build shelters. And that's just the beginning. They'll need much more, especially food and Coal.
Aid for New Manchester
With basic shelter secured, the most pressing need is food. Hunger has forced these people to do dire things… May God forgive them.</n></n>Gather enough Food Rations and have automatons carry them to New Manchester.
Food for New Manchester
The supply of food we've sent should get them through the storm. But New Manchester won't survive without a sufficient Coal supply for their Generator.</n></n>We’ve estimated the amount they’ll need and… it doesn’t look good. Let's do what we can.
Coal for New Manchester
There are tears of gratitude in the eyes of the people of New Manchester when the final transport reaches their city.</n></n>We did what we could. Their fate is out of our hands now.
New Manchester cared for
Howling winds descend upon the city, extinguishing all hope. We are not prepared.
The storm hits the city
The storm has hit the city and we don't have enough supplies to outlast it.</n></n>This is the end of our efforts...
The storm hits the city
We've gathered enough supplies to survive the storm. Everything else has been taken care of.
Supplies ready
We need to get the Generator working. It provides heat and power to other buildings. Without it we'll freeze to death.</n></n></n></n>Stockpile some Coal and start the Generator.
FIGHT THE COLD
The Generator hums with reassuring warmth, but we shouldn't take it for granted. If the Generator goes down, the city dies. Be mindful of Coal reserves.</n></n></n></n>Now, food - there'll be no city if we starve to death. Secure a way to provide Raw Food and build a Cookhouse to prepare meals.
FOOD
Our people found a trail leading into the wilderness. We should follow it. We must find other people and ask them for help to secure our survival.
SEARCH FOR OTHERS
With basic resources secured for now, we can try to rescue the people we left behind.</n></n>Build a Beacon, scout Frostland and save as many survivors from our expedition as possible. You'll need a Workshop to design plans for more advanced buildings.
PEOPLE FROM OUR CONVOY
Our people found a trail leading into the wilderness. We should follow it. We must find other people and ask them for help to secure our survival.
SEARCH FOR OTHERS
The news has shocked everyone in the city. There were supposed to be many settlements and construction crews here, people living normal lives in homes heated by Generators...</n>But we're alone.</n>|#color=d21820|</n>HOPE FALLS
WE ARE ALONE

[NOT USED] UWAGA - PLACEHOLDER!
Sir, now we can clearly see what the refugees were running from.</n>The Great Frost is coming.</n></n>We have to prepare. Our scientists say they can calculate the severity of the storm from observations. They just need a day or two to prepare their instruments and install them in the Beacon.
What looms ahead
Sir... The scientists couldn't believe their eyes, but they've double- and triple-checked their calculations. They say the strongest winds of the storm will cause the temperature to plummet beyond anything we've ever experienced before.</n></n>Hunting will be impossible. The plants in the Hothouses will freeze. Everyone left outside the city will perish, and so will we if we can't heat our homes properly. We have to prepare!</n>|#color=d21820|</n>Hope falls
PREPARE FOR THE STORM
The people you saved barely managed to reach the city in time. At least we have a critical supply of food ready. There's not much time left  we should use it to prepare whatever else we can. After the storm hits, there'll be nothing we can do but wait it out.
Preparations finished
The food supplies should keep us fed for at least a week.</n></n>Let's pray the storm subsides before then.
Food supplies ready
Everyone with a mission away from the city is back and safe.</n></n>If it's possible to be safe from the cold coming our way, that is.
All teams back in the city
We saved everyone we could from the places we knew were still sheltering survivors.</n></n>God help the rest...
Survivors rescued
We did what we could to raise the heat output of the Generator.</n></n>This alone might not be enough – all our homes and workplaces should be as warm as possible. The cold that's coming could kill in minutes.
Generator ready
We've failed to prepare adequately and our survival is hanging by a thread.</n></n>Be wary of the falling temperature and try to survive until the end of the storm.
SURVIVE THE STORM
We didn't even try to understand what the storm would bring. We are completely unprepared.</n></n>Regardless, be wary of the falling temperature and try to survive until the end of the storm.
SURVIVE THE STORM
We've prepared well for the coming storm.</n></n>Now all that's left is to survive until it passes...
SURVIVE THE STORM
We've done what we could to prepare. We didn't finish in time, but now it doesn't matter.</n></n>Be wary of the falling temperature and survive until the end of the storm.
SURVIVE THE STORM
You promised to set up Coal Thumpers and Gathering Posts to make up for the falling output of our Coal Mines. You didn't deliver on that promise.</n></n>People are desperate and their faith in you – and their survival – dwindles.</n></n>|#color=d21820|Hope falls
Coal supply not secured
You built additional Coal Thumpers and Gathering Posts to make sure the Coal supply is secured for the duration of the storm.</n></n>People feel reassured with your decisive action.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
Coal supply secured
You promised to provide each household with an emergency supply of Wood, but you failed.</n></n>People are desperate and their faith in you and their survival dwindles.</n></n>|#color=d21820|Hope falls

You open the stockpile for everyone to take home emergency Wood supplies. This will let them reinforce their houses and provide emergency heating if everything else fails.</n></n>People feel reassured with your decisive action.</n></n>|#color=4ac5e8|Hope rises
Wood supplies secured
The wind dies down and the temperature finally starts to rise.</n></n>An eerie silence descends on the city...

The |#color=FFD000|Automatons|#defaultcolor| can replace entire crews at most workplaces. They are produced in the |#color=FFD000|Factory|#defaultcolor| and work 24 hours per day. Their initial efficiency is 60%, but it can be raised by researched upgrades. An automaton recharges itself twice daily from the Generator or a Steam Hub without interfering with its operation.
AUTOMATONS
There are two types of buildings with area effects. Some buildings, like Sawmill, have an area from which the |#color=FFD000|resources|#defaultcolor| can be gathered and some others the area in which they can affect |#color=FFD000|people|#defaultcolor| (e.g. House of Prayer) or |#color=FFD000|places|#defaultcolor| (Field Kitchen).
AREA EFFECTS
The Londoners are a group of people who are so frightened by the situation that they want to go back to London in a misguided belief that it’s the only way to survive. </n>People will join the Londoners when the |#color=FFD000|Hope|#defaultcolor| level is low and leave them when it's high.</n>The Londoners will challenge your rule, provoking conflicts and urging others to leave the city. The intensity of the conflict depends on the general condition of the society.
THE LONDONERS
Building an Outpost Depot allows you to assign people to work as an |#color=FFD000|Outpost Team|#defaultcolor|.
Send an Outpost Team to establish an |#color=FFD000|Outpost|#defaultcolor| in Frostland at a location rich in resources. The Outpost will send these resources to the city once per day until you order the team to return to the city.
OUTPOST
THE STORM AND CITY READINESS
RESOURCES AND WORKFORCE
The sole reason for the existence of your city is to keep the |#color=FFD000|Seedling Arks|#defaultcolor| safe. They contain the seeds and seedlings of plants from all over the world that will be used to bring the earth back to life once the great winter ends.</n></n>The Seedling Arks must be kept at least |#color=4ac5e8|Chilly|#defaultcolor| at all times. When the temperature in a Seedling Ark falls below this level, a warning with a timer will appear over it. When the timer runs out, the seeds and seedlings will die.
THE SEEDLING ARKS
In this scenario you can employ Engineers and Automatons as |#color=FFD000|Scouts|#defaultcolor|. Engineers can be employed from the start, but to employ automatons you first have to research the |#color=FFD000|Automaton Scouts|#defaultcolor| technology.
To select what kind of Scouts to create, click on the arrows in the Beacon Panel.
SCOUTS
The people of New Manchester won't survive the storm without our help. To send them aid, you need to stockpile a certain amount of resources and construct some automatons first. The |#color=FFD000|Relief Expedition|#defaultcolor| can be then sent from the Beacon Panel.
AID FOR NEW MANCHESTER
In this scenario you can build |#color=FFD000|Guarded Outpost Depots|#defaultcolor|, which secure the perimeter of your city and protect it from incursions by the lords.</n></n>You'll find the Guarded Outpost Depot in the Tech Tab in the Construction Panel. Build them on the walls of the hole, just like the Outpost Depots they replace.
GUARDED OUTPOST DEPOTS
By clicking on the arrows to the left and right in the upper part of a building panel, you can quickly cycle through |#color=FFD000|all the buildings of the same type|#defaultcolor|. This comes in handy when your city starts getting bigger and you want to check the condition of all your healthcare facilities, for example.
SWITCHING BETWEEN BUILDINGS
The Generator heats a circular zone around it, consuming at least 6 units of Coal per hour. You can research |#color=FFD000|Generator upgrades|#defaultcolor| that raise the heat output, expand the heat zone and reduce Coal usage.
GENERATOR
Keeping homes and workplaces as warm as possible helps prevent people from getting ill. Some workplaces might become inoperative if the temperature falls too low.
TEMPERATURE
CONSTRUCTION
STREETS
The |#color=FFD000|Cookhouse|#defaultcolor| prepares meals for people. It produces 2 Food Rations from 1 unit of Raw Food. Raw Food is provided by |#color=FFD000|Hunters|#defaultcolor| and |#color=FFD000|Hothouses|#defaultcolor| and is sometimes found by Scouts during their exploration. When there are no Food Rations to be had, people will start eating Raw Food.
FOOD AND HUNGER
Research is grouped in |#color=FFD000|tiers|#defaultcolor|. You have to research a tier upgrade before you can start researching technology in that tier. Researching each topic costs resources and takes time.

|#color=FFD000|Coal Thumpers|#defaultcolor| wash Coal from cracks in the rock to the surface. You can order people to gather the Coal from the piles directly, or employ them in |#color=FFD000|Gathering Posts|#defaultcolor|. More than one Gathering Post might be needed to collect all the Coal efficiently.
You unlocked a new building ability by signing a law. Building abilities can affect society in many ways. Each has a cooldown and many also a cost. You can find out more about a given ability in the building's panel.
The temperature in the city is constantly changing. Pay close attention to the forecast for the next five days that is shown to the right of the temperature at the top of the screen.</n>A thermometer icon indicates the direction of the temperature change. Hover the mouse over it for details.</n>
When it gets colder outside, the temperature inside buildings drops as well. Buildings differ in the amount of protection they offer from the cold.</n>To see all the factors affecting temperature in a building, hover the mouse over the thermometer icon in its panel.
In extreme circumstances, the Generator can be put into overdrive. This will increase the heat it provides, but also put the Generator under |#color=FFD000|stress|#defaultcolor|. Keep an eye on the stress gauge. When it reaches 100%, the Generator will explode.
Cold homes or workplaces cause people to get sick. Without proper care, they can become gravely ill and might die. The sick can be treated in |#color=FFD000|Medical Posts|#defaultcolor|, but the gravely ill need an |#color=FFD000|Infirmary|#defaultcolor| to be treated. Until you build one, you can save their lives by signing one of two laws:</n>The |#color=FFD000|Radical Treatment|#defaultcolor| law allows you to treat the gravely ill in Medical Posts, but some of them will be left as amputees.</n>The |#color=FFD000|Sustain Life|#defaultcolor| law allows you to keep the gravely ill alive (but untreated) in Medical Posts or Care Houses indefinitely.
People may become |#color=FFD000|amputees|#defaultcolor| as a result of serious frostbite, work accidents, other mishaps or after becoming gravely ill and being saved by Radical Treatment. The amputees can't work, but they still need to be housed and fed. Later in the game, you can research upgrades that will help you to find solutions to this problem.
You can store up to 900 Coal and 300 of every other resource here. When this limit is reached, the gathering or extraction of a given type of resource will stop.</n>To raise this limit, build a Resource Depot and set it to store the desired resource. Each Resource Depot can store 900 Coal or 300 of any other resource.
Many buildings, such as the Cookhouse or Medical Post, must be at least |#color=FFD000|Chilly|#defaultcolor| or warmer inside to function. Place them in the heat zone around the Generator or a |#color=FFD000|Steam Hub|#defaultcolor|, otherwise they could stop working when the temperature falls low enough.
The Beacon gives you access to the world outside the city. You can explore it with |#color=FFD000|scouts|#defaultcolor| deployed through the Beacon panel.
Scouts are self-sufficient and can venture great distances from the city. They may find precious resources, survivors and perhaps shed light on the world and its fate.</n>The progress of your scouts is shown through the icons in the upper-right corner.
|#color=FFD000|Hope|#defaultcolor| and |#color=FFD000|Discontent|#defaultcolor| levels are crucial for the social stability of the city. There are many factors that can affect them. The most important are:
You can move the camera with your mouse while holding the right mouse button. You can also use the |#color=FFD000|WASD|#defaultcolor| keys or just move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen. To zoom in and out, use the mouse wheel.</n>To rotate the camera, press the mouse wheel and move the mouse, or use the |#color=FFD000|Q|#defaultcolor| and |#color=FFD000|E|#defaultcolor| keys. 
Some buildings, such as the Medical Post or the Workshop, require intense mental labour from the people employed there, and as such can only be staffed by |#color=FFD000|engineers|#defaultcolor| – |#color=FFD000|workers|#defaultcolor| only provide manual labor.</n></n>|#color=FFD000|Children|#defaultcolor| can't be employed at all initially.</n>You can check your workforce distribution by clicking on the icon in the bottom-right corner.
The city wakes up at about |#color=FFD000|06:00|#defaultcolor|. People have some free time until the work shift starts at |#color=FFD000|08:00|#defaultcolor|, unless there's construction work to do. After they finish their shift at |#color=FFD000|18:00|#defaultcolor|, they are free... to help with construction again, which can keep them up well past midnight. You can |#color=FFD000|extend|#defaultcolor| the 10-hour work shift if you sign certain laws.
People who become amputees will move to |#color=FFD000|Care Houses|#defaultcolor|, freeing up their homes for others to live in. Care House residents can't work, but only eat half as much as others. If the |#color=FFD000|Sustain Life|#defaultcolor| law is signed, the gravely ill will also move to Care Houses.
People in treatment don't go to work until they are healed. This lowers the |#color=FFD000|efficiency|#defaultcolor| of their workplaces. Numerous sick absences can seriously affect your economy.</n>To get ahead of this problem, provide adequate healthcare by opening enough facilities to treat all sick people quickly.
Once they reach an unexplored site, scouts will await your orders. To issue them, click the highlighted icon.
Scouts will often need your decision on how to deal with what they find. Note: Scouts carry the resources they recover with them, so in order to make use of those resources you need to call them back to the city and wait for their return.
You can speed up time by clicking the game speed buttons found to the left of the temperature at the top of the screen. You can also bind keyboard shortcuts to the game speed buttons in the |#color=FFD000|Settings|#defaultcolor| menu, which can be accessed by clicking on the icon in the upper-left corner. The game will slow down to normal speed when something important happens as well as each day at 05:00. You can pause the game by pressing the spacebar.
Most buildings require you to assign people to work there. Certain buildings only employ |#color=FFD000|engineers|#defaultcolor| and others only employ |#color=FFD000|workers|#defaultcolor|. To assign people to work, click on a workplace and use the assignment panel.
Resource management is crucial to the city’s survival. You need |#color=FFD000|Coal|#defaultcolor| to power the Generator. |#color=FFD000|Wood|#defaultcolor| and |#color=FFD000|Steel|#defaultcolor| are necessary for construction and research. |#color=FFD000|Steam Cores|#defaultcolor| are a key part of advanced buildings. |#color=FFD000|Raw Food|#defaultcolor| is used to prepare |#color=FFD000|Food Rations|#defaultcolor| in the Cookhouse. Later in the game, more types of resource may appear.
|#color=FFD000|COAL|#defaultcolor| is required to power the |#color=FFD000|GENERATOR|#defaultcolor|. |#color=FFD000|WOOD|#defaultcolor| and |#color=FFD000|STEEL|#defaultcolor| are necessary for construction and research. Raw Food is used to prepare |#color=FFD000|FOOD RATIONS|#defaultcolor|, which are citizens' preferred source of nutrition.</n></n>More types of resource may appear later in the game.
The Generator is the heart of the city and the only source of |#color=FFD000|heat|#defaultcolor| in this frozen hole. You should turn it on as soon as you stockpile enough Coal. 
The temperature inside a building depends on the power setting of the Generator (if the building is in a heat zone), that building's insulation and the conditions outside. There are six temperature levels:
Use the Construction menu at the bottom of the screen to order the construction (or dismantling) of buildings and streets. Only people who are not currently at work can build structures.
Buildings inside the heat zone are warmer and provide better living and work conditions. To make the best use of the heat zone, buildings are placed on a radial grid. All buildings must be connected to the Generator by a street in order to function.
All structures in the city must be connected to the |#color=FFD000|Generator|#defaultcolor| with streets, otherwise they won’t function. To build a street, open the Construction panel and click the Build Street icon.
Use the |#color=FFD000|Workshop|#defaultcolor| to develop new buildings and improvements. 
|#color=FFD000|Hunters|#defaultcolor| leave the city to hunt in the Frostland for food. They work from 6 pm until 6 am. Initially, they bring up to 15 units of Raw Food from each hunt. Research upgrades to significantly increase hunt yield.

This is the beginning of the end. The storm is coming and when it reaches the city, there will be nothing more you can do but wait it out.</n>The storm moves towards the city, destroying and killing everything on its way, including any Outpost Teams and Scouts caught on the Frostland. It will bring with it |#color=FFD000|extreme cold|#defaultcolor| which will render some facilities inoperative. The city has to be well prepared to survive this natural disaster.
You can now deploy an outpost team and send it to build a permanent Outpost outside of the city. The Outpost Depot will service the connection with it and receive shipments sent by the Outpost.</n></n>To set up another Outpost, you'll need to build another Outpost Depot.

He is the voice!
He is our shepherd. He will save us!
Our Captain is the voice of God.
These filthy heretics can't leave. We'll make them stay, no matter the cost.
He is our shepherd. He will save us!
The Captain is the voice of God.
We are the chosen ones! The last stand! We will prevail!
Work and order! Winterhome fell, but we'll succeed!
Hope is for the weak! We have strength and courage!
We are the chosen ones! The last stand! We will prevail!
They endanger our survival. We will prevail, no matter the cost!
Hope is for the weak! We have strength and courage!
Dad, I don't want to die.
That is the most terrifying and yet the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Dear Lord, have mercy...
Oh God, its coming!
Mum, what's that?
This is the final trial. We must face it boldly...
Dear Lord, have mercy...
What is that?!
Mum's terribly worried, but she won't tell me why...
This can't be happening. For God's sake!
We have to prepare ourselves!
Is it just me, or is it getting darker?
With the wind blowing so hard, I can barely walk!
Blimey, it is getting darker!
Well, at least the fires of Hell are probably out by now...
We have to make this final effort.
Daddy... daddy? Help! Anyone...?
Hell's gates have been cast open and all its demons are here.
My lungs... they feel like they're on fire...
Is the snow's whiteness blinding me, or is the sun dimming?
I never thought I'd see my dad panic.
Lord, have mercy on me, for I have sinned.
Lord, I am ready. Take me to Your kingdom.
I can barely see a thing. Is it that white or that dark?
So this is how it ends.
Forget it! We'll find the culprit without you.
We can only despair. There is no hope.
Maybe he knows who did it? Or was it him?
You're unfit to lead, you dunce.
You let a man-eater walk among us?!
I hope he dines on you, you bloody fool. 
What if the cannibal goes after fresh meat?
Our leader says it's fine to eat people!
I'm horrified. This is a sign of the end times.
This place will break us all, one by one.
Any bite marks? Maybe a dog did it?
A cannibal among us! I won't sleep easy.
What kind of a bugger eats dead people?!
Now we can't rest even after death.
We must find this fucker and kill him.
I know hunger, but it doesn't justify this!
A wise choice. But we still need a cemetery.
Very well. Justice must be served.
May God have mercy on this lost soul.
I'd sleep easier if we also had a cemetery.
We'll get this fucker. It's like a tiger hunt.
I can't wait to get my hands on him.
All right, but what about the bodies?
God bless you, we really needed that.
Shame it took an atrocity to move you.
A cemetery won't help us find this monster.
One good thing about this horrible event.
Good! We should've done it long ago.
Yes sir, bury the body, bury the problem.
What about finding out who did it?!
I still want to off the bloody man-eater.
This place is a deadly trap! We need to get out of here!
Don't panic! We aren't dead yet! We have to learn from their mistakes!
Why did Winterhome fail? Are we all going to die here too?
Terrible... All these poor people... We can't end up like them!
We must save ourselves and our children. We must go back!
They're all dead?!
We should've stayed in London. Surely it couldn't have fallen like this!
How are we supposed to survive if they didn't?
We should never have left Britain...
Coming here was a fool's errand. We should go back!
He's got blood all over his face!
What a mess! Did he ran into a wall?
He looks scary. What happened to him?
What a thorough thrashing.
He's bleeding! Get him to the medic!
They're like animals. No rules, no mercy.
Why can't these people get along?
That's a right drubbing if I ever saw one.
Oh, who did this to you buddy? 
Ow. What a ruin his nose became.
Poor man, this will take a while to heal.
Picked a fight with the wrong guy, it seems.
Our leader knows how to counter the Londoners' propaganda.
This'll stop him from infecting others with his madness.
Very wise! We can't let him spread the lies of the Londoners.
Too right! This'll stop him from leading our people astray.
Revenge? They can't be serious. This man was just doing his job.
It seems that your response has only enraged the Londoners.
What good will this do? All you've done is angered the Londoners.
The Londoners are threatening our man! 
Heavens, they can't... No! Stop it! Our Captain sent him!
Get away from him! You can't treat him like that!
No! Leave him be! He's on duty! Stop it!
Hey! Hey! What're you doing? Bloody Londoners!
How could our Captain allow this to happen?
Murderers! His blood is on your hands too, sir...
How could they?! Fucking monsters.
Bloody hell, they crossed a line this time. We'll make them pay...
How could you? There were innocent people in the crowd!
Stop this outrage! We're within our rights!
You despot! Those people were peaceful!
You'd turn on your own people?! You bloody bastard!
Not everyone in that crowd was a Londoner!
How can you treat us like that just for listening to someone?!
I'm getting anxious. Maybe we really don't have another choice.
He sounds so convincing. Maybe we should think again.
After listening to that Londoner, it doesn't seem like there's any hope for us here.
I was sure the Londoners were wrong, but now... I don't know.
Maybe going back isn't as ridiculous as I thought.
Let's leave this hellhole before we all die here!
Yeah! The Londoners are right! We should go with them!
When they put it that way... They might be right after all.
This is outrageous! We're not even short on food!
Nothing justifies this! Nothing!
Burn in hell, you vile wretch!
You sick bastard! You'd feed our own children to us!
Can't you see he's a false prophet, an enemy of the true faith?
Look what we've become! A godless herd, blindly following lies!
Shut up already!
Who are you to stand here and spread your lies?!
We can't leave such behaviour unpunished.
We must teach them a lesson, or they'll grow more insolent.
I agree! These criminals can't get away scot-free.
Too right! This'll show them.
Good! We might see some law and order at last.
I hope this will stop the descent into violence.
Well, better late than never.
Let's hope it's enough to protect us from these vermin.
This is intolerable! Sir, you have to do something!
The Londoners are becoming a danger to us all.
These vermin are getting cocky. Let's teach them a lesson.
Captain, if you ignore this, you'll put us all at risk.
"The Captain will kill us all." That's a little bit strong, I'd say.
I won't be swayed by slogans, but I'm not so sure about others.
Common folk are vulnerable to such simple messages.
The authority of our leader will suffer if he doesn't do something, 
"Come with us if you want to live." Bollocks. Live where?!
This is ridiculous! Why are we letting them get away with this? 
Captain, are you going to let them mock you like that?
"Fuck this place." That's what half of us say, and the rest think.
How can they take our supplies like that? Our survival is at stake!
Every unpunished theft erodes the people's trust in law and order.
It's not just selfish – it puts us all in danger. We must act!
I thought we left petty thievery behind when we came here.
How can people stoop so low! These supplies belong to all of us!
We've worked hard to get where we are, and these bastards just take it from under us!
Why doesn't our captain do something about these thieves?
It's worse than Whitechapel on a Sunday with all this stealing.
We have to stop the thieves! Captain, let us hunt them down!
These thieves think they can take our supplies and get away with it!
How can our Captain ignore this?
Our leader must be aware of the consequences.
Why does our Captain refuse to act?
Ignoring such troublemakers won't make them disappear.
This is outrageous. We should lock him up.
This traitor must be stopped!
Shutting your eyes won't make the problem go away!
Scum like him should be hanged!
Liar! Traitor! 
Why is he even allowed to speak?! 
How is faith going to save us?
We have to take matters into our own hands
If the panic spreads, we'll meet the same fate.
If we give into fear, we'll fail!
God will save us! We just have to show him our devotion.
We mustn't lose hope. We're here for a reason.
A long, dark night awaits us. We have to be strong.
God and hard work will save us.
God will save us? We should save ourselves! Let's go back!
Maybe faith really is our only hope...
Winterhome fell because it lacked faith.
God will save us? We should save ourselves! Let's go back to London!
Maybe faith really is the answer...
Maybe God's blessing will give us strength!
United we survive! Only order can give us stability!
Anarchy – not the cold – was the downfall of Winterhome!
There's no future here! We have to go back to London!
We'll find survival in unity! Only order can give us stability!
If we work hard, we'll survive!
There's no future here! We have to go back to London!
Sing, brothers! These hymns truly work wonders.
All our troubles are trivial in the face of eternity.
Have faith, brothers and sisters! We shall see the spring yet!
Those who seek hope, raise your eyes to the heavens!
Our faith will guide us through the ice.
Faith is our only hope in this frozen hellhole. Let us pray!
Scum like you are a plague infesting this world.
You will bring doom upon us! </n>Confess!
You are not saved! You are not clean! You are not worthy!
I hope this will prevent further bloodshed.
Good! Murderers should be granted no clemency.
It won't bring him back, but it's the right thing to do!
Justice! Catch the Londoners! Show them we aren't afraid!
I hope this is enough to prevent further bloodshed.
At last! Swift and decisive action is what we need.
They killed him just for doing his job. We should show no mercy!
This promise won't bring him back, but it's something.
The Londoners have shown they'll stop at nothing. We must act.
We must find the murderers and punish them!
They killed him just for doing his job. We should show no mercy!
Captain, this man gave his life for us all. Do something!
We survived! We made it!
We made it...
Its over, I cannot believe it, its finally over...
We did it! We survived the final blow! We will live!!
We have to start work on prostheses immediately.
He wasted so many lives...
We can do it. We must.
Now that bastard will work till he bleeds.
Don't fret, we can do better than this halfwit.
Now we have to go hunting. At last!
I'm scared. What happens now?
What're we going to do?
Now who'll make our city great again?
We can start rebuilding at last.
Good riddance! We'll be better off without him.
He should be happy we didn't wring his neck.
A fitting end for a bloody despot.
Now we can start rebuilding at last.
Die, you scum!
I hope he suffers for eternity.
Run! Run for your lives!
It's going to blow! Hide!
No! Nooooo!
What's happening?!
I'm glad I'll never see him again.
Banishing him won't save us, but it's a relief.
What does it change? We're doomed anyway.
Lucky bastard, he'll die quickly...
Justice must be served.
A fitting end for a bloody despot.
Death to the tyrant!
I'll piss on your grave!
We could have done more. So much more...
All for nothing. We failed our brothers and sisters.
I can't believe we let so many die.
This is all our Captain's fault.
All for nothing. The green earth is dead forever.
I gave my life for this?! How could we let the Arks freeze?
We had one goal – to save the seeds – and we failed.
We could have done more. So much more...
All our work, all our sacrifices were for nothing.
After all our effort, we'll end up dying in a fucking blizzard.
I can't imagine what's happening in New Manchester now.
We didn't save a thing, not even our own lives.
We came so far just to die in a bloody blizzard.
We couldn't even save our own lives, let alone the Arks.
We were sent to save the world, and we die like rats in a hole.
What a way to die, knowing that all hope dies with us...
Automatons are mankind's greatest creation!
It's safe, right? I'm sure our inventors thought of everything.
Automatons really are a marvel, aren't they?
I heard it can replace an entire team of workers!
That thing's bloody massive!
Are automatons dangerous?
What did you call that thing? An automaton?
I bet it'll do a lot to help us!
It's tragic. We should've persuaded them to stay.
I'd hoped they'd eventually see reason...
I can't believe it... I knew some of them. I never thought they'd do this.
What a waste of lives. We should've stopped them somehow.
They're really leaving! Are they mad?
Maybe they're right? Maybe London is the last bastion?
They're all going to die!
God, please watch over them.
Reason prevails in the end.
If they'd left, they would've died. But we all stay together!
We are together again!
We are united again!
No more division! We are one society!
No matter the cost, we couldn't let the Londoners leave, we did the right thing.
We need to get out of here! We're doomed if we stay!
Our children have no future here. We must go back!
It's hopeless. We should go back.
There's nothing to do here but wait for death.
What fools we were. Now we'll all die in this hole. 
There's nothing left to hope for...
We should go back to London!
Do we have any chance of surviving here?
We should never have left Britain...
We were fools to come here. We should go back!
I guess we can talk about this tomorrow.
I admit I didn't think of all the aspects.
Let's meet again when we think this through.
We shouldn't just give up like that.
Now you're talking sir! Here's to you!
What's wrong with you people?! I give up...
Oh, why worry, things will be fine I'm sure.
Well, all right. I'll try to think about it.
It's so kind of him. I didn't expect this.
I'm sure he can handle this problem.
I feel that we've been bribed. It's not right.
Our commander surely knows best.
All right, we can talk this over, I guess.
Well, I kind of see his point now.
I'm not giving up! Let's meet tomorrow, ok?
Maybe there's more to it than I thought.
It's so kind of him. I didn't expect this.
I'm sure he can handle this problem.
I feel that we've been bribed. It's not right.
Our commander surely knows best.
All right, we can talk this over, I guess.

I'm not giving up! Let's meet tomorrow, ok?

I guess we can talk about this tomorrow.
I admit I didn't think of all the aspects.
Let's meet again when we think this through.
We shouldn't just give up like that.
Now you're talking sir! Here's to you!
What's wrong with you people?! I give up...
Oh, why worry, things will be fine I'm sure.
Well, all right. I'll try to think about it.
Our leader's incompetence is putting the future of mankind at risk!
With the fate of humanity at stake, it's time we had a better leader.
God is our only hope. Our inept leader should see that and resign.
I pray our Captain sees the light. He must mend his ways.
We know what to do and how, we just lack a good leader!
Dear Lord, show the Captain the error of his ways so he resigns before it's too late.
Our Captain makes it hard to hate the sin and not the sinner.
God forgive me, I dreamt that our Captain died and I rejoiced.
We're doing our best, but this bumbling fool is ruining everything!
I'd be a better leader than our Captain. Anyone but him, really.
I can't look people in the face. We've failed them. You've failed them, sir!
We'll go straight to Heaven, because we've been in Hell.
Our captain is a bloody fool! How can he ignore our misery?!
I'd gladly go to hell if I could send this bastard Captain there first.
We trusted the Captain, and what do we get? Fuck all!
Work and pray? To hell with all that nonsense! We're done for!
God help us, our Captain is leading us to perdition!
All I  pray for now is a quick and painless death for us all.
This can't last! We have to do something before it's too late.
I think people are looking forward to a change in command!
God, please deliver us from our Captain or make him see light.
All our bloody toil's for nothing when we have such a fool for a leader!
I pray our Captain stops wasting everyone's efforts.
How will our leader fail us today? Life's hard enough as it is!
Having such a useless leader is our Lord testing us.
How much longer must we suffer this idiot of a leader? 
I put my trust in providence, not in our failed leader.
Let's get moving! I wonder what we'll accomplish today.
What a lovely morning! I'm ready to take on the day.
Thank you, Lord, for this glorious new day.
I think we're truly blessed – our Captain most of all.
Let's give thanks to our Lord for all His blessings.
I believe God must have saved us for a purpose.
Rise and shine, people! Look, the sun's up already!
God bless our Captain! I'd follow him anywhere.
I'll remember to thank our Captain in my prayers.
This place is killing us slowly with despair.
Arise, serfs! A new day of useless struggle awaits.
You saved us, Lord, but to what end?
Will the rest of my life be like this? God, give me a sign!
We have everything we need to live, but nothing to live for.
We must pray for a purpose to guide us. Just surviving isn't enough.
Work, work, nothing but work...
Please, God, send a ray of hope into our lives.
Is this endless toil the fate we want for our children?
We survived another night... that has to count for something.
I've got to hold on. People are depending on me.
Dear Lord, may this day be no worse than yesterday.
Let's praise the Lord for preserving us.
At least we're alive, unlike so many others.
We're doing fine, all things considered.
Another day, another shift. Well, such is life.
God helps those who help themselves, so keep working!
Have faith! We've made it this far – we'll stick it out to the end.
Our prospects aren't bad. We just have to endure a bit longer.
I admit, I feel a little hopeful today in spite of the circumstances.
Let's start the day by giving thanks to the Lord our God for His deliverance.
With His help, I think we can make it.
Our Captain may be fallible, but faith will show him the right path.
There's still a lot to do, but I can see that our work is bearing fruit.
I have our Captain in my prayers. May our Lord guide him.
We must hold on. We'll see better days, I'm sure of it.
God made this place to test us. But we are strong.
I dreamt I was back in London. What a disappointment...
The pitiful gains of our daily struggle only delay the inevitable.
Have mercy upon us, O Lord. 
Another day, another shift. There's no more to life than work.
Back to the dreary old drive.
I pray that something changes, but every day is the same.
Every day it's harder to get up.
What's the point of all our toil? My God, I'm so tired...
This world's condemned. Prayer is my only solace.  
Look sharp! Remember, we mustn't shrink from our duties.
We should be grateful for what we have... I suppose.
Lord, give me the strength and hope to last till tomorrow.
There are ups and down, but we're alive. Let's keep it that way.
Another day of work... to keep us warm and fed, God willing.
Dear Lord, I hope this day won't be worse than the last.
Let's make it through the day. Maybe tomorrow'll be better.
I pray nothing terrible happens today.
Time to shoulder my yoke and pray that the burden is light.
Our leader's incompetence is putting the future of mankind at risk!
With the fate of humanity at stake, it's time we had a better leader.
I fear that everything we've achieved might be wasted by our Captain.
We could thrive here, but not carrying on like this.
We know what to do, we're just lacking proper leadership!
To hell with the Captain! We could do a better job than this!
If we weren't being led by such a bloody dunce, we might have a chance of survival!
Mark my words, if our Captain were gone, we'd all be a damn sight happier.
We're here doing all we can, while that useless clown's ruining everything!
I'd be a better leader than our Captain. Anyone but him, really.
I can't look people in the face. We've failed them. You've failed them, sir!
Why get out of bed? It's pointless. We're doomed.
The Captain's a bloody fool! Doesn't our misery count for anything?!
No hope, no respect... and soon no Captain!
We trusted the Captain, and what did we get? Fuck all!
I'll die happy if I live long enough to see our Captain's dead body tossed in the snow!
Work? What's the point? The Captain's doomed us all!
Sod it all. We're all going to die anyway with this maniac leading us.
This can't last! We have to do something before it's too late.
I think people are looking forward to a change in command!
I fear our workers won't endure this all much longer.
All our bleedin' hardship, and for what? Sod the Captain!
We'd be doing much better if we just had a proper leader.
I wonder how our glorious Captain's going to fuck things up today?
Long day of pointless work ahead... again.
How much more of this do we have to take?
Bloody hell, I've had just about enough of this. We need a new leader!
I pray for our captain to see light. He needs to mend his ways.
We know what to do and how, we just lack a good leader!
Let's hope that our leader will see the error of his ways.
Hate the sin, not the sinner... But our captain makes it hard.
God forgive me, I dreamed that our captain died and I rejoiced.
We're doing our best, but this bumbling fool ruins everything!
Our captain is a bloody fool! How can he ignore our misery?!
I'll go to hell gladly if I can send this bastard captain there first.
We trusted the captain, and what do we get? Nothing!
Work and pray? To hell with all that nonsense! We're done for!
God help us, our captain is leading us to perdition!
I only pray now for quick and painless death for us all.
All our bloody toil is for naught because our leader is a fool!
I pray that our captain stops wasting everyone's efforts.
How will our leader fail today? Life's hard enough as it is!
Our Lord is trying us by giving us such an useless leader.
How much longer must we suffer under our idiot of a leader? 
I put my trust in the Providence, not in our failure of a leader.
I think we are truly blessed, and our captain the most.
Let's thank our Lord for all His blessings.
I believe that God must have saved us for a purpose.
Rise and shine, people! Look, the sun's up already!
God bless our captain! I would follow him anywhere.
I'll remember to thank our captain in my prayers.
Will all the rest of my life be like this? God, give us a sign!
We have all we need to live, but not what to live for.
We must pray for a vision to lead us. Surviving isn't enough.
Work, work, nothing but work...
Please, God, send a ray of hope into our lives.
Is this endless toil the fate we want for our children?
Let's praise our Lord for preserving us.
At least we are alive, unlike so many others.
We are doing fine, all things considered.
Another day, another shift. Well, such is life.
God helps those who help themselves, so keep working!
Have faith, we made it so far, we will stick it out to the end.
With divine help, I think we're going to make it.
Our captain might be fallible, but faith will show him the right way.
There's still a lot to do, but I can see that our work brings fruit.
I remember our captain in my prayers. May our Lord guide him.
We must hold on, and we'll see better days, I'm sure.
God made this place to test us. But we are strong.
Another day, another shift. There's no more to life than work.
Back to the dreary old drive.
I pray that something changes, but all days are the same.
Each day it's harder to get up.
What's the point of all our toil? My God, I'm so tired...
This world is condemned. Prayer is my only solace. 
There are ups and down, but we are alive. Let's keep it that way.
Another day of work... to keep us warm and fed, God willing.
Dear Lord, I hope this day won't be worse than the last.

Let's get moving! I wonder what we'll accomplish today.
What a lovely morning! I'm ready to take on the day.
Good day! Let's see how to make our city even better.
Things are going well. We've got the Captain to thank for that!
Let's thank the Lord for all His blessings.
Today'll be a good day. I can feel it!
Rise and shine, people! Look, the sun's up already!
God bless our Captain! I'd follow him anywhere.
We made it so far. I think we can survive anything!
This place is killing us slowly with despair.
Arise, serfs! A new day of useless struggle awaits.
Food and shelter aren't enough. We have no future.
We haven't got any purpose or direction. A new leader is needed.
We've got what we need to live, but nothing to live for.
We live to work, and that's it. What's the point?
Work, work, nothing but work...
We're getting by, but what future do we have?
Is this endless toil really what we want for our children?
We survived another night... that has to count for something.
I've got to hold on. People are depending on me.
Sometimes I wonder what the purpose of our struggle is.
Get a move on, chaps, there's still plenty of work to do!
At least we're alive. Not everyone's so lucky.
We're doing fine, all things considered.
Another day, another shift. Well, that's life.
We can keep going like this for a while, I'd say.
Let's get to work. We can't let up now.
Our prospects aren't bad. We just have to endure a bit longer.
I admit, I feel a little hopeful today in spite of the circumstances.
Good day! I hope we can keep saying this sincerely.
We could be doing better, but I'll admit, things are looking up.
It's not so bad, there's always tomorrow to look forward to.
There's still a lot to do, but I can see we're making progress step by step.
I hope today's a good day. Better than yesterday, that's for sure!
If we just keep at it, we'll see better days, I've no doubt.
God made this place to test us, and we'll prevail.
I dreamt I was back in London. What a disappointment...
The pitiful gains of our daily struggle only delay the inevitable.
We demand a lot of our people, and for what? A few days more?
Another day, another shift. There's not much more to life than this.
Back to the gloomy old grind.
The writing's on the wall for our Captain.
It's getting harder to drag myself out of bed every day.
I'm starting to worry we'll lose what little we have left.
Yet another hopeless day in this frozen hellhole.
Look sharp! Remember, we mustn't shrink from our duties.
We should be grateful for what we have... I suppose.
Well, time to get out of bed and back into the fray.
There's ups and down, but we're alive. Let's keep it that way.
Another day of work... to keep us warm and fed, God willing.
I just pray we get by. Nothing more, nothing less.
Let's make it through the day. Maybe tomorrow'll be better.
Well, I can certainly remember worse mornings. Better ones, too…
God, I'm so tired. Every day's the same grind, but we've got to keep going.
Our leader's incompetence is putting the future of mankind at risk!
With the fate of humanity at stake, it's time we had a better leader.
Let's oust this useless wimp. Our people deserve better!
This fool is too weak to lead us! We'll forge onwards without him!
We know what to do and how, we just lack a good leader!
To hell with the Captain! We'd do just fine without him!
We'd be much better off without this damned fool leading us!
We're winning! It's just our leader holding us back! 
Only our Captain stands between us and victory now!
I'd be a better leader than our Captain. Anyone but him, really.
I can't look people in the face. We've failed them. You've failed them, sir!
Time for a change. Only a strong ruler can save our city.
If we don't unite behind a strong leader, we're doomed.
No hope, nothing but disregard for us. But not for long, oh no!
We must rise as one to replace this weakling with a real man.
I wish I could kill this bloody bastard before I die.
We're headed for ruin with this weak-kneed waste of space! 
Fuck it all. We're going to die anyway with this idiot leading us.
This can't last! We have to do something before it's too late.
I think people are looking forward to a change in command!
We need law and order, but also competent leadership.
Our Captain couldn't lead a pig to mud! We deserve someone better!
We'd be doing much better if we just had a decent leader.
Things are going to Hell with this weakling pretending to lead us!
It's going to be a long day of pointless work... again.
We need a strong leader, or there'll be no future for us.
Bloody hell, I can't stand any more of this. We need a new leader!
Let's get moving! I wonder what we'll accomplish today.
What a lovely morning! I'm ready to take on the day.
I'm proud to be a citizen of this city. Three cheers for our captain!
Things are going well. We should thank our Captain for that!
Day after day we find power in unity. Victory will be ours!
Today will be a good day. I can feel it!
We'll beat the cold and hunger! United we will prevail!
United people under a strong leader have nothing to fear.
We've made it this far. I think we can survive anything!
This place is killing us slowly with despair.
Arise, serfs! A new day of useless struggle awaits.
We're just cogs in a machine, efficient but without higher purpose.
Another day of pointless toil...
Captain, what're we doing all this work for?
We only live to work. What's the point?
Work, work, nothing but work...
We're surviving, but what kind of future do we have?
Every time I get up I feel exhausted. Captain, we need a purpose!
We survived another night... that has to count for something.
I've got to hold on. People are depending on me.
The worst is still to come. We must stay united.
Get a move on, lads, there's still plenty of work to do!
We have to close ranks and work together. 
Be vigilant. Only law and order stand between us and disaster.
Our Captain has my full support. We can get through this.
Let's move, people, our Captain is counting on us!
Let's get to work. We can't let our guard down.
Our prospects aren't bad. We just have to endure a bit longer.
I admit, I feel a little hopeful today in spite of the circumstances.
We should encourage people to show support for our Captain.
We could be doing better, but I have to admit things are looking up.
It's not so bad, there's always tomorrow to look forward to.
The Captain is leading us in the right direction. We should support him.
I hope today's a good day. Better than yesterday at least!
Our lot will only improve if we stand behind our leader!
We have to work as one under the guidance of our leader if we want to survive.
I dreamt I was back in London. What a disappointment...
The pitiful gains of our daily struggle only delay the inevitable.
The workers won't stay motivated for long if we don't give them hope.
Things are falling apart. How long will our Captain be able to hold us together?
Another day of fighting chaos and anarchy. I'm so tired...
I don't think our Captain will lead us much longer.
We work like slaves, and it's all in vain. We're going to die in this hole.
I'm getting the sinking feeling we're going to lose what little we have left.
I miss the order and harmony of our past lives in London.
Look sharp! Remember, we mustn't shrink from our duties.
We should be grateful for what we have... I suppose.
Our people need inspiration. We should lead by example.
Let's not lose hope. We can still make it if we work together.
We have to unite behind our leader! It's the only way forward!
I just hope I can get by. Nothing more, nothing less.
Let's make it through the day. Maybe tomorrow'll be better.
Well, I can remember worse mornings. And better ones too.
Don't despair. Law and order will save us if we keep giving it our all.
We failed to weed out the faithless and we're suffering for it.
We're being tested. We must work harder.
Where did we go astray? God, show us the light!
Heresy is still blooming in our city!
We can trust only our Captain. Apostates are among us!
Can't you smell the foul stench of heresy?!
Wake up and look around! We must cut out the rot!
All the sacrifices we've made... for this?! 
I devote every day of my work to the survival of our city.
Another day to prove the strength of our faith.
Pray like everything depends on God. Work like everything depends on you.
Bless this morning! We get to live another day.
Another blessed day in the city of the faithful!
Through our devotion we've been given a chance. To waste it is to sin.
Every new day is both a blessing and a test of our faith.
Our struggle saves our lives. Our faith gives them meaning.
Wake up! Our faith won't save us if we neglect our duty!
The flesh is weak. Nourishment comes from doing His will.
I offer my suffering to my brothers and sisters in faith.
Work and pray, that's the only way!
We must work harder to prove our faith.
There's still the stench of heresy somewhere in our city.
Idleness is the enemy of the soul! Let's get moving!
Keep your eyes peeled! Enemies of the faith may still be hiding among us.
Watch out! The saboteurs are still hiding amongst us!
The closer to victory, the harder the struggle!
We must find and kill the traitors before they ruin everything!
All the sacrifices we've made... for this?!
Wake up and look around! We must eliminate the traitors!
We must work harder. Enemies are still in our midst.
Who's ruining our efforts?! We must find them and kill them!
Honour! Loyalty! Courage!
Freedom in unity, survival in work!
We're all happy and thankful to our Captain!
Where there's unity, there's always victory!
We owe our lives to the Order!
Onward, brothers and sisters! To work!
Every day I pledge my life anew to our Captain.
It's cold and it's hard, but we must stand united!
Stay together and remain vigilant. There's still much to do.
The world's gone to hell, but we will prevail as one!
Stand firm and carry on working. We must beat the cold.
When steel shatters like glass, our hearts will endure!
Watch your backs, people. We still have to weed out the traitors.
Keep your eyes open! There may be traitors amongst us!
We have to get organised. We have to do something!
I wonder if our Captain really has a plan.
How are we going to survive? What should we do?
Other cities may have fallen, but not London. It's impossible.
All our work'll be for nothing if we leave. I'm staying.
We aren't going to make it in this hole. We have to leave.
We won't survive this!
We have to prepare if we want to stand any chance of survival.
How will we manage against that monstrosity...
The wind... I can't hear my own thoughts!
Hell has frozen over...
I didn't think it was possible for it to get this cold!
Why did you do that? Put it back! You're our prophet! You should know better!
What are you doing? Those are a symbol of our faith!
Those buildings are a representation of us now. You can't just destroy them.
Stop! We need those buildings to ensure order!
You can't do that! Those buildings ensure Order!
What are you doing! We need those places! 
How could we do that?!
And good riddance. We're stretched thin as it is.
This is terrible. We'll answer for this before God.
Ever heard of a rotten compromise, sir?
Good decision. Our city will benefit.
There were children in that group!
I hope we won't regret it...
At least make yourselves useful! Get to work!
We couldn't have done it any other way.
I must say, I'm a little relieved.
Armed or not, they're dangerous.
Now they'll pay for what they did to us.
What's that noise? What's going on?
Wake up! Wake up! They're stealing from us!
Thieves! Thieves! 
My God, there are so many of them!
They're here! The lords are here!
What do they want?
Calm down. Let's wait and see what happens. 
It’s the lords! We're doomed!
My God, what if they're armed?
We have blood on our hands.
They had it coming.
Shame on us.
Oh God, please don't let this be true!
This is not happening...
No mercy!
To the gallows!
Hang them! Hang them high! 
No more lords! No more lords!
Kill them all!
Let's kill the bastards!
To hell with them!
No more lords! No more lords!
Kill them all!
No mercy!
This is the last time they steal from us!
We'll teach them not to take what's ours.
Let's get them!
They did it!
They're here!
It's about time.
I'll be damned!
Well, look who's here.
Come, come! Every pair of hands counts.
There's a lot to do, but here we work for ourselves.
Good to see you, lads! Here you'll be safe from the lords. 
I hope you gentlemen aren't afraid to get your hands dirty.
Sod the lords. This place belongs to us.
Welcome, mates! Good to see you again!
Good to see you again!
Good, there's plenty of work to do.
Welcome, mates!
Please, don't leave them on their own.
We must find the lost children at all costs.
Those poor parents. I can't imagine what they're going through.
They could've died.
You'll be safe here.
Thank God! I've been praying for them.
We could've helped them.
It's our Captain's fault.
This shouldn't have happend.
We'd better watch out, there's no telling who's coming in that ship.
Another ship? Well, I'll be damned!
Could they be refugees like us?
We have to help them.
It could've happened to us too.
Bloody avalanche! 
This is horrifying. How could he?
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I was afraid it would come to this.
This is horrifying. How could he?
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I was afraid it would come to this.
I remember that turn. It was hard to find the right way.
We have to rescue them.
Damn fools. What were they thinking?
Guess that's it then.
There's no one to wait for any more.
So here we are.
Since you're already here, get to work!
If it was the other way around, they wouldn't let us in.
We should put our people first.
It was the only way, I suppose.
I feel bad about this.
Good. We don't need them here.
Since you're already here, get to work!
If it was the other way around, they wouldn't let us in.</n>
We should put our people first.
This is a mistake.
To hell with this! Send them back!
They're a danger to us all!
This is a mistake.
I feel sorry for them, but our safety comes first.
We couldn't have helped them anyway.
The farther away from us they are, the better.
This is a mistake.
To hell with this! Send them back!
They're a danger to us all!
This is a mistake.
Poor little darlings.
Great. More children. Just what we need.
Craven is here?! That leech should hang!
Shame. Shame on us.
Have mercy, they're just children!
What if they were our children?
Poor little darlings.
Great. More children. Just what we need.
Craven is here?! That leech should hang!
Enough is enough! Let's get them!
Let's show those bastards!
Screw them! They don't belong here!
If we turn our backs on them, they'll die.
Help them? To hell with that!
The lords are at our mercy. What a twist of fate...
No mercy! No mercy!
Get them!
Death to the lords!
I can't imagine what that man's been through.
We have to send scouts to New Manchester at once.
Another city? Incredible. 
This shouldn’t have happened.
I blame our leader for this.
We're failing our mission.
How tremendously irresponsible. 
Damn it! We should've done more.
Another automaton is ready.
This one looks sturdy.
All the cogs are oiled.
Pressure normal and steady.
Is there really nothing we can do for them?
I feel sorry for them, but our mission comes first.
We can't just turn our backs on them.
We should do everything we can to help those poor people.
We should focus on our mission.
Helping them is our moral duty.
This is inhuman.
Are we really going to let them starve?
We can't endanger our mission for any reason.
Let's hope we can afford this.
Won't it put our mission at risk?
If they're starving, we have a duty to feed them.
We can do better than this.
May God have mercy on our souls.
They'll die without our help.
I hope our leader knows what he's doing.
We should help them, but not if it puts our mission at risk.
We can't provide for New Manchester forever.
They probably thought no one from the first expedition got through.
These people are suffering, and we're doing nothing to help. It’s a disgrace. 
I hope they get here safely.
We did our best, we can only pray now...
I hope we did enough.
The final test of our city begins.
I hope our sacrifice won't be in vain.
This will have to be our legacy.
We should help them! We'll be no better than them if we refuse.
We should focus on our city! They're doomed and we still have a chance.
We don't have the time and resources to secure both cities.
Our survival will be pointless if we don't help them.
We have a moral obligation to help them.
We don't owe them anything. We must secure our city!
That's what will happen to all the evildoers.
The cost of sin is death.
The city must be purged of evil. 
Another enemy of the Faith. How many more are hiding in our city?
Death to the enemies of the Faith!
We should kill them all, one by one.
No mercy for the wicked!
I'd never have thought this one was with them...
That's what will happen to all the enemies of order.
This is what you get for trying to overthrow order!
Order requires sacrifice.
Another public enemy. How many more are hiding in our city?
Death to the public enemies!
We should kill them all, one by one.
No mercy for the criminals!
I'd never have thought this one was with them...
Every death is a tragedy, but they were unrepentant.
I didn't expect them to have such conviction. Obstinate fools.
They had no faith! Now they'll learn to listen.
Had we let them go. Who knows how many would've followed.
It's a tragedy, but threats to order must be dealt with by any means necessary. 
If only they'd listened to us! But there's no arguing with fear.
Serves them right, I say. If you're not with us, you're against us.
Those fools would all have died if we hadn't stopped them.
Order dawns on our city.
This sign will remind everyone that we're a city of order.
This sign will strike fear into the hearts of villains.
Order above all!
May the traitors cower in terror!
That's it! No mercy for our enemies!
Order dawns on our city.
This sign will remind everyone that we're a city of order.
This sign fills our hearts with pride.
Order above all!
Now we're well and truly a city of order!
Glorious! May the flag fly over our city forever!
Remember, it's a small price to pay for your salvation.
It'll soon be over and you'll be with us again.
They who stray from the righteous path bring pain on themselves.
Accept the pain. It's never too late to repent.
This will beat all the wickedness out of you, scum!
It hurts, doesn't it? I know it hurts. And so it should!
Stop fighting. The pain will cleanse you.
Look how they writhe as the evil leaves them!
This is... I'm lost for words. 
Oh God, either we starve or eat our dead...
I won't touch meat ever again. Oh, I'm going to sick up!
Bastard! How does he expect us to live with ourselves?!
Amazing. Our scientists have found yet another way to help us survive.
Prostheses may be expensive, but for many of us they're priceless.
It'll give these people their lives back, in a way.
At last they will go back to work and help us all.
There's no place for privacy when souls are at stake.
It's regrettable, but we must expose the sinners to save them.
I fear many innocent people will be falsely accused.
My neighbour offended our Captain! And he's cheating on his wife!
Death is an everyday thing here. Why celebrate it?
Bless you! Each of our fallen must be honoured.
Our dead ones deserve no less.
Fancy burials? Who has the time for that?
It's a practical solution, and in our situation that's what counts.
They'll just have to hang on until we come up with something better.
Well, it means more beds and food for the rest of us...
It's the best we can do for them right now.
This will be a lasting sign of our covenant with God.
What better testament to our faith could we offer?
We should think of everyone's needs, not just the faithful.
Let's build it! That'll show the unbelievers!
Knowing the dead will rest in peace is oddly comforting.
I'm glad we'll treat the dead with dignity.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. As it should be.
At least after death we'll be allowed to rest properly.
Our own Department of Truth to tell us what to think.
I suppose it'll help keep people happy... and under control.
So, they'll ask us how do we do and tell us we're doing great?
Complain too much and they'll drown you in lies.
A place to gather and praise the Almighty. What a godly plan!
Our people will surely appreciate it. As do I, of course!
Good. I miss praying together.
At last. We should've built a House of Prayer long ago.
Splendid! The righteous have nothing to fear.
Wise indeed! This'll only strengthen our faith further.
At last there'll be someone to intervene!
When the heathens are on the rise, we need someone to protect us.
We're just speeding up the natural process of decomposition.
The dead can help us after all. Isn't that what they'd want?
Bury the dead, isn't that what the scripture says?
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. And more food to us.
We gave up our freedom to survive.
From now on, nobody will dare utter a word of dissent.
The city must survive. Nothing else matters.
You have my heart and my hands.
A humane measure, but is it prudent in our current situation?
Helping the sick? I'm in favour, as long as we can afford it.
Whatever gets them well faster. We need them.
Can I get some more food too? Look how pale I am!
I wonder how the old notions of honour apply in our new world.
Yet another spectacle to distract us from the terrible reality.
Sometimes the only way to settle a fight is to raise the stakes.
We're just going to let people kill each other? Where's the justice in that?
I hope these shifts are only used for real emergencies.
Preposterous! Are you trying to work people to death?!
Twenty-four hours on the job? Insane. But that's our lot…
Work, work, work until you die…
Good! We depend on engineers for every day of our lives in this city.
I look forward to the day art and literature return to our schools.
A wise decision. Little hands can do a lot of good.
Right, it's time for the children to start earning their keep too.
A new light has been lit to cleanse our sins.
Praise our Captain for showing us the true path!
Faith is my sword and my shield.
We beg forgiveness and pray that we sin no more.
Well, lots of people enjoy these violent shows...
I wonder if the fighters will abide by the rules.
Good! Betting on fights was the next best thing to the races.
I'm itching to see a good fight. It'll be just like old times.
What an inspired, practical idea!
The good word and a hot meal warm both the body and the soul.
Hot soup and a word of prayer beats cold meat and hard tack.
I'm not going to complain about being fed better in this damned cold.
Supervised work is almost always more productive, I hear.
The workers might need someone to tell them what to do, but not us!
Maybe this will make things run smoother... Time will tell.
Oh! I used to be a factory foreman.
Lovely! We deserve some fun from time to time!
Is this how we're going to solve our problems now?
I agree, we need law enforcement. Every city in the world had it.
Well, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.
Finally there'll be someone to go after the criminals.
And when they have to choose, who will they protect: us or our leader?
I know many will complain, but we must work harder to survive.
Fourteen hours?! People will barely have time to eat and sleep!
What, ten hours isn't enough? I suppose in our circumstances…
My father used to tell us we're lucky to work ten hours a day...
Natural healing is slower, but does no harm, as God intended.
I'm sure the sick will appreciate having a place to rest for a few days.
With faith and dedication we can work miracles.
Our brothers can heal my blisters without cutting my hand off!
I regret that such a harsh decision was deemed necessary.
That's terrible! Have we really no other choice?!
God, please save our children from harm!
This will end with a child dying at work. Mark my words.
Surely we can find a way to educate some of them?
But our children aren't used to working! They'll get hurt!
We toil all day, and now the kids have to work too?
Kids should be learning, not working!
Makes sense to me! But they should do some learning as well.
Good. It's better to keep the children out of harm's way.
Kids could do something useful during their time in the shelter.
And what are they going to do all day, watch the snow fall?
I guess it'll help keep spirits high – and efficiency too.
Do we really need to be constantly reminded to work harder?
We're already sweating blood, yelling at us won't help!
Now everybody will hear how important our work is.
Helping the sick will be good for the kids' character.
A first step towards medical education... We can be proud of this.
Good, let the kids learn. We need more skilful medics.
Well, it's surely better than letting them bum about all day.
Nothing wrong with a stiff drink from time to time.
I certainly hope people enjoy their liquor in moderation.
A glass a day keeps the worries away.
I've missed a good tipple.  
The words of the scripture will bring us wisdom and peace.
Communal prayers will surely strengthen our faith.
Any reason to come together is good.
A heartfelt prayer can give hope to those who are lost.
And so begins the transformation of our city into a garrison.
I think it's a waste of time, but if it helps morale...
It'll be good to meet with everyone each morning.
We could use a reminder of what we're fighting for every day.
A volunteer force would be better, but I'm glad we'll have them.
It seems like a good idea, but I worry where it may lead.
I feel safer knowing my neighbour is watching my back.
Good! We need someone to keep the peace and watch for trouble.
What is the truth? Our Captain has the answers to all of life's mysteries.
What does it change? We live and die by his word already.
He is the voice of truth! He will save us!
We all have to obey his orders, so why not make it official?
Splendid. Pack them together like sardines. The strong will survive.
It's certainly more economical than just building more facilities.
Our sick will be crammed like in a poorhouse. 
If the ill have somewhere to lie, they have a chance to recover.
Yeah, why should the coppers just sit in their cosy stations?
Good. This'll keep the crooks off the streets.
With guards on the streets, everyone will feel safer.
It'll be encouraging to meet the law face to face.
Here we are, reduced to poverty. Such is the price of survival...
Now we'll know how the poor ate in the workhouses.
Anything to calm the growling stomach. Just like in London...
I hate soup! All my life it's been thin gruel and empty promises.
It's sad that it's come to this, but we have to deal with criminals.
The troublemakers should be separated from society!
Lock them up! All of them!
We'll build it for criminals only to end up there ourselves someday.
It's regrettable that we have to use such measures.
Criminals must be reformed, but is that enough to justify this?
A few punches and anyone will promise to be good.
They'll say whatever just to make the beating stop.
This will turn our people against each other.
Everyone should report crimes, but this law goes too far.
They want us to rat on each other. I'll never do that!
I'd better watch out, the neighbours will be falling over themselves to sign.
Some people can't live without pleasures of the flesh, apparently.
Old vices come back to haunt us. We'll pay for this, mark my words.
Another step closer to the old ways we left behind in London.
And who's going to work there, volunteers? Yeah, I didn't think so.
The sinners will have a chance to save their souls from damnation.
Let the purifying voice of the truth be heard throughout the city.
Sinners have to repent or die! Only the truly faithful are safe.
I will confess my sins to the Almighty! Not to a bunch of thugs!
I'm looking forward to an evening at the pub with friends.
I counted pub visits among the simple pleasures we lost forever.
A pub – just like in London! Let's call it the Pipe and Hole.
A pub will remind us of home… and help us forget our woes.
It may make sense, but that doesn't make it any less cruel.
Even with all our advances in medicine, we have to resort to this?
At least we'll be saving lives...
I just hope they won't cut my leg off if I fall ill.
Practices like this were outlawed for good reason!
Isn't there something safer than sawdust?
Wait, won't we get sick if we eat that?
Sawdust in bread? What's next, stones for pillows?
Shrines will remind people that their work has a higher purpose.
Is there really nothing more pressing than erecting shrines?
At last, somewhere to say our prayers in peace.
With so much to do, we really need to be reminded to pray.
Piling up the dead in the snow? What a disgrace!
Snowbanks for graves?! Where's the dignity in that?
Bodies dumped in the snow like rubbish… What've we come to!?
Are we so numb that we're fine just leaving the dead in a heap?
This is only a half measure. We need an infirmary!
They can't be helped, so why give them false hope?
Why take up all the beds with these goners?!
I suppose that's better than letting them die.
It makes perfect sense – I just hope it won't be me.
Making use of the useless? Who would object to that!
I'm not letting anybody cut me up into parts!
We're treating the dead like just another resource.
May God forgive us, but we just can't save everyone.
It's a hard decision to make, but we live in hard times.
The doctors will just pick who lives and who dies? That's scary.
If you can't get back to work fast, you're useless. I get that.
It's so cold! Better not to go outside without a good reason.
The temperature's starting to make life really difficult.
It's getting colder with each day.
I hope I don't freeze to death on duty.
A record low temperature! I hope this one isn't broken for a while...
It's so cold my thermometer shattered.
It's colder than when we fled from the storm.
It's bloody freezing! I hope I don't get frostbite.
Without our technology, we'd all freeze to death in hours.
I can't think in this cold. I need to go inside.
Oh God, I don't want to freeze to death.
How can we survive in cold like this?!
Unbelievable. It's colder than a Siberian winter.
It's so cold our alcohol's as thick as oil.
How are we to live now? You go outside and you're dead!
Oh God, I didn't think it could get this cold.
Sir! There are prisoners running free!
Why are there prisoners on the streets? Is something wrong at the Prison?
This isn't order – this is the complete opposite!

We roam the still, cold world. No horizon in sight.
We bid farewell to plenty. And for those who remained, came the time to adapt.
We decided to leave our homes and head north.</n>
We roamed for weeks… Maybe months...</n>
Leaving behind all the things we once believed had made us.</n>
It was hope...
...that pushed us forward.
Slowly. Step by step.
We knew the cost of our journey.
And we’ve paid the price
A hundred times.
The rulers-of-old. </n>Stripped of pride and glory.</n>
Finally... the time has come.
To build the last city on earth.
The city must survive
It feels as yesterday, we were turning the </n>wheels of progress.</n>
Until the frost... stopped it all.
Suddenly. Without a warning.
When tides had changed... they changed for all of us...
...no matter wealth or class.
We have lost our world to snow and with it, our last traces...
...of humanity
